# Automatic_frequency_Planning
##  AUTOMATIC FREQUENCY PLANNING AND OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM FOR CELLULAR NETWORKS 
## Based on Channel borrowing to optimize channel utilization in th cellular cluster 
##	The Object Objectives 
	Main Objective 
Modeling an automatic frequency channel assignment so as to reuse of frequency with the cluster based on Time division multiple access (TDMA). 

	Specific Objectives 
•	Modelling the seven convention module for a dynamic channel allocation using TDMA.


•	Modelling a micro-cell and a macro cell of the primary cell cluster in cellular network. 


•	Modelling channel borrowing based on traffic density and Erlang B traffic formula within a cell to optimize channel cell utilization. 
	
  
 ## Methodology   
  First Objective 
  
For our first objective  a 7 convention cluster is model to represent the network cluster. 


Second Objective

Implementation of micro-cell within the 7 cells inside the cluster such that there shall be a total of 6 micro-cell in the cluster.


Third Objective

Modelling of this based on cell splitting into macro and micro cells with channel borrowing concept.

## Simulation 
I did the simulation in Matlab. 
## Results
The figures has the snippets of the final simulation results.
The Final folder has the matlab simulation codes for the objectives

## Final Year Engineering Project 
This is a final Year project to  project proposal submitted to the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of the degree of Bachelor of Science in 
Telecommunication and Information Engineering.
